      About Us
    </h2>
    <p class="mt-8 text-center text-sm leading-5 text-gray-600 max-w">
      Launched in March 2020 by a group of <%= CITY_NAME %> residents in response
      to local nonprofits’ increased need for volunteers as they build up capacity
      to support the community during COVID-19 and the ongoing economic crisis,
      New Haven Help With COVID is a partnership platform where nonprofits can
      efficiently recruit volunteers in the Greater New Haven area for in-person
      <u>and</u> remote opportunities.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-center text-sm leading-5 text-gray-600 max-w">
      500+ volunteers with various skills from mask-making and grocery deliveries
      to social media management and computer programming skills have signed up,
      and 20+ nonprofits big and small have successfully found their volunteers
      here.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-center text-sm leading-5 text-gray-600 max-w">
      If you are a <%= CITY_NAME %> nonprofit interested in learning more about
      how our platform can best support you, contact us at
      <%= mail_to HWC_EMAIL, nil, target: '_blank', class: 'text-primary-500' %>.
      We send out weekly newsletters to our volunteers about the latest opportunities,
      and our team is happy to provide custom support for your organization—from
      posting opportunities and collecting applications to targeted recruiting.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-center text-sm leading-5 text-gray-600 max-w">
      We believe good tools should be shared. If you are currently outside of
      <%= CITY_NAME %> and think that your local community could use a partnership
      platform like ours, reach out to us at
      <%= mail_to HWC_EMAIL, nil, target: '_blank', class: 'text-primary-500' %>.
      We are happy to discuss about sharing code and best practices.

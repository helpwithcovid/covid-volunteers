## Credits

This gem is the cumulative effort of the Ruby community.
It started with the extlib inflecto originated from [active_support](https://github.com/rails/rails), then dm-core inflector originated from [extlib](https://github.com/datamapper/extlib).
Later, [`inflecto`](https://github.com/mbj/inflecto) was extracted from [dm-core](https://github.com/datamapper/dm-core) as a standalone inflector.
Now, we resurrect `inflecto` and merged [`flexus`](https://github.com/Ptico/flexus), with some inflection rules from [`hanami-utils`](https://github.com/hanami/utils).

This is `dry-inflector`.

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
